  <h1> Malai Tikka Page</h1> 
  <p>Malai tikka, also known as murgh malai tikka or malai boti, is a classic South Asian appetizer featuring creamy, melt-in-your-mouth chicken. The dish is characterized by its signature white appearance, which contrasts with the vibrant red or yellow of regular chicken tikka. The word "malai" translates to "cream," a key ingredient that gives the dish its rich, smooth flavor and tender texture</p>
