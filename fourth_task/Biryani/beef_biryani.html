    <h1> Beef Biryani Page</h1>
    <p>Beef biryani is a flavorful, multi-layered South Asian rice dish featuring tender, spiced beef and aromatic basmati rice, often garnished with fried onions, herbs, and nuts. The dish is a result of slow cooking, creating a rich, savory flavor that comes from the spices absorbed by the meat and rice.</p>
